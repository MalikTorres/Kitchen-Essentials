            <p class="text">Sous vide, which means “under vacuum” in French, refers to the process of vacuum-sealing food in a bag, then cooking it to a very precise temperature in a water bath. This technique produces results that are impossible to achieve through any other cooking method.</p>

            <p class="text" >First off, an Instant Pot isn't just an electric pressure cooker. As a true multicooker, it sears, browns and sautes food like a stove-top skillet. It also steams delicate items such as fish, eggs and vegetables. Instant Pots double as standalone electric rice cookers as well.</p>

            <p class="text">A chef knife is one of the most important tools you can have in your kitchen. It is widely known that knives are defined mainly by their hand-feel. However, a good knife should be about much more than just a comfortable handle.</p>
